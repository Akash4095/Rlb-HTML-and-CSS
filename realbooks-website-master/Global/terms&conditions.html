                    <br> We shall be under no obligation to provide the Service if the subscription fee is not paid to us on time. The Account Holder must ensure that we have complete and accurate billing and contact information throughout the subscription period, including the full name of the Account Holder, its business address, and a billing contact email address.

                    <strong>Suspension or termination</strong>
                    <br> If you fail to abide by these Terms of Service, or if payment of the subscription fees is not paid on time, we reserve the right to deny access to the Service. If we withdraw access to the Service no refund will be payable by us. One month’s notice will be given prior to the suspension of an account after which time if any issue has not been resolved within the following month we will take action to disengage ourselves as your Agent. We also reserve the right to close any RealBooks account for any reason, by giving one month’s notice. Suspension of your account could seriously jeopardize our ability to manage your company accounts and could lead to the missing of submission deadlines. RealBooks cannot be held liable for any fines incurred resulting from this.

                    <br>

We cannot guarantee that it will be error-free, timely, reliable, entirely secure, virus-free or available at all times since we are dependent on the reliability of the Internet and your use of your own computer to access the Service.

You obtain no ownership rights in the Service or any of the Intellectual Property Rights pursuant to or arising out of this Agreement.

                    <strong>Exclusion of our liability</strong>
                    <br> You use the Service entirely at your own risk. We do not restrict our liability (if any) for personal injury or death resulting from our negligence, for fraud committed by us or for any matter, which it would be illegal to limit or to attempt to restrict. We exclude all other liability and responsibility for any amount or kind of loss or damage arising in connection with the Service.

                    <strong>Limitation of our liability</strong>
                    <br> Neither party shall be liable under this agreement to the other party for indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including without limitation loss of goodwill, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract or otherwise. Where we are not legally entitled to exclude our liability, our total liability for any loss or damage relating to the Service (or to our website generally) shall not exceed an amount equal to the subscription fees, which the Account Holder has paid to us in the previous month.
